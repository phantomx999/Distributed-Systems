Note:

We were off by about 5% from the expected sentiment value results.  

We also did not get the sort function working for the output.txt file returned to client.  

For analysis of our times based on the graph, we noticed the random
timing schedule did not have much of a difference for prob-load values 
except for when all load values for all nodes equaled 0.0.
Moreover, for our load scheduling policy, when prob-load values 
were low and equal (0.1 or 0.0), our time results were lower as well.   

You can run different test results for load-prob for various nodes by simply running

> ./server <node1 load_val> <node2 load_val> <node3 load_val> <node4 load_val> ......

All of our test prob-load values that we tested are written out and displayed on our graph.
