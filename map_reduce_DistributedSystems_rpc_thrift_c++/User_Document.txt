First, make sure CSE lab computer has the correct thrift files.  You can do this by 
typing 

> ssh atlas.cselabs.umn.edu  

in terminal while in the CSE network.  Then type command

> locate libthrift

to make sure correct thrift file is located there.  

Open folder and run 

> thrift -r --gen cpp project1.thrift

to create gen-cpp folder.  

In the same current directory, type

> make

from the makefile to compile client.cpp, server.cpp, and node.cpp, as well as constants *.cpp files, etc.   

Side Note:
to make client only
> make client

to make server only
> make server

to make node only
> make node


Now that client.cpp, server.cpp, and node.cpp have been compiled, open up at least 6
terminal windows (1 for client, 1 for server, 4+ for nodes).  

Now first run the server......

In first window, to run server, type:

> ./server <node1 load_value> <node2 load_value> <node3 load_value> <node4 load_value> 

where nodeN load_value is the probability load value for each respective node.  

For example:
 
> ./server 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.9 


After this, in another terminal window, type

> ./client <ip> <port> <input_directory> <mode number>

where in this example,  ip is ip address ("localhost"), port is port being run on, input directory is the input file to perform the job on,
and mode number is the type of scheduling for program to run 
(1 for random, 2 for load probability, and if no char entered, then automatically runs random).

for example:

> ./client localhost port data/example 1



After this, in other terminal windows, to run a node: 

> ./node <id address> <port>

for example:

> ./node localhost 9002


Multiple nodes can be run, one node per terminal window.  4 or greater nodes can be run for program.
