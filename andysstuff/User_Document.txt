First, make sure CSE lab computer has the correct thrift files.  You can do this by 
typing 

> ssh atlas.cselabs.umn.edu  

in terminal while in the CSE network.  Then type command

> locate libthrift

to make sure thrift is "/usr/local/lib/libthrift.so" file is located there.  

Open folder and run 

> thrift --gen cpp project1.thrift

to create gen-cpp folder.  

Now move server.cpp, client.cpp, and node.cpp files into gen-cpp.  Then go
into gen-app directory

> cd gen-app

Now type

> make

from the makefile to compile client.cpp, server.cpp, and node.cpp.

(Side Note:
to run client only
> make client

to run server only
> make server

to run node only
> make node

to run test
> make test)

After client.cpp, server.cpp, and node.cpp have been compiled, open up several
terminals.  

In another window, to run server:

> ./server

In one terminal window, type

> ./client <ip> <port> "test" <mode number>

where in this example ip is ip address ("localhost"), port is port being run on, test is ,
and mode number is the type of scheduling for program to run 
(1 for random, 2 for load probability).

In other windows, to run node(s): 

> ./node <id address> <port>

Multiple nodes can be run, one node per terminal window. 

Once client, server, and node(s) windows are all connected and up and running
